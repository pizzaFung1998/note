# Tips

Remember that enumeration is an iterative process. After performing our **Nmap** port scans, make sure to perform detailed enumeration against all open ports based on what is running on the discovered ports. Follow the same process as we did with Nibbles:

- Enumeration/Scanning with **Nmap** - perform a quick scan for open ports followed by a full port scan

- Web Footprinting - check any identified web ports for running web applications, and any hidden files/directories. Some useful tools for this phase include **whatweb** and **Gobuster**

- If you identify the website URL, you can add it to your '/etc/hosts' file with the IP you get in the question below to load it normally, though this is unnecessary.

- After identifying the technologies in use, use a tool such as **Searchsploit** to find public exploits or search on Google for manual exploitation techniques

- After gaining an initial foothold, use the **Python3 pty** trick to upgrade to a pseudo TTY

- Perform manual and automated enumeration of the file system, looking for misconfigurations, services with known vulnerabilities, and sensitive data in cleartext such as credentials

- Organize this data offline to determine the various ways to escalate privileges to root on this target

There are two ways to gain a footholdâ€”one using **Metasploit** and one via a manual process. Challenge ourselves to work through and gain an understanding of both methods.

There are two ways to escalate privileges to root on the target after obtaining a foothold. Make use of helper scripts such as **LinEnum** and **LinPEAS** to assist you. Filter through the information searching for two well-known privilege escalation techniques.

Have fun, never stop learning, and do not forget to **think outside of the box**!
